**TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning library used to build and train neural networks. In this code, it's used to load the CIFAR-10 dataset and define the CNN architecture using Keras APIs.

Keras Layers and Models (layers, models) provide building blocks for creating deep learning models. Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers are used to extract features and classify images. models.Sequential allows stacking layers in order.

Matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library used for visualizing data. In this code, it plots training and validation accuracy over epochs to monitor the model's performance.

NumPy is a numerical computing library used for handling arrays. Although not directly used in operations here, it is commonly involved in data manipulation tasks and is imported for potential use.

CIFAR-10 Dataset is a standard dataset included in TensorFlow with 60,000 images across 10 categories. It is used to train and evaluate the CNN model.
